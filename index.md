## A Short Introduction

I am currently a sophomore CS student at Boise State University. I'm originally from Portland, Oregon and I've been interested in computers and programming as long as I can remember. I enjoy anything sports, music, computers, and family. I hope to stay after college and find a job in Boise. 

## My programming experience
I am currently finding open source projects to work on and things I can do within the Boise State community. Most of my experience is classes. I have multiple years of experience using Java. I am currently taking data structures, version control, systems programming, agile development, and microprocessors. 

###  A short list of non-CS related classes

- Technical Communications
- Discrete Mathematics
- Engineering Statistics
